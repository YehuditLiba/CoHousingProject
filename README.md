*** Welcome to my spectacular project ***
a communal housing committee management system focusing on optimization and efficient management of shared living spaces🏠
This project is designed for managing and maintaining communal housing. The application provides a variety of services for building management by the committee, 
including adding and removing tenants, managing payments, tenant details, and renovation proposals. 
Additionally, users are invited to provide feedback and impressions of the project. 
All of this is facilitated through a user-friendly application developed with a strong emphasis on maintained development and the highest level of performance and security.

The project's code is managed and organized systematically.
Basic analysis is conducted in the early stages of the project, including understanding user requirements, 
inputting them into the code structure and documentation, and building the code based on this data. 
Each part of the code receives detailed explanations and comprehensive documentation,
enabling everyone to understand their work and contribute to the project.

Join us and experience the revolutionary change in housing management👍🏻
